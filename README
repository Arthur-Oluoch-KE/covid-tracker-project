# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This Jupyter notebook provides an interactive analysis of global COVID-19 trends using the [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases) dataset. It enables users to select countries and date ranges for customized exploration of cases, deaths, and vaccinations.

## Features

- **Data Loading & Cleaning**: Imports and preprocesses the latest COVID-19 data.
- **User Input**: Allows selection of countries and date ranges for focused analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Computes key metrics and descriptive statistics.
- **Visualizations**:
    - Line charts for total cases, deaths, and vaccinations over time.
    - Bar charts comparing total cases by country.
    - Interactive choropleth map of global cases.
- **Key Insights**: Summarizes important findings from the analysis.

## How to Use

1. **Install Dependencies**  
     Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
     - pandas
     - matplotlib
     - seaborn
     - plotly

     You can install them with:
     ```
     pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
     ```

2. **Download the Dataset**  
     Download `owid-covid-data.csv` from [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data).

3. **Run the Notebook**  
     Open the notebook in Jupyter and execute the cells.  
     - You will be prompted to enter countries (comma-separated) and a date range (YYYY-MM-DD).
     - The notebook will validate your input and proceed with the analysis.

## Notebook Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**  
     - Loads the dataset and previews its structure.
     - Checks for missing values.

2. **User Input**  
     - Prompts for country selection and date range.
     - Validates input.

3. **Data Cleaning**  
     - Filters data by selected countries and dates.
     - Handles missing values via interpolation.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
     - Calculates death rates and descriptive statistics.
     - Summarizes total cases, deaths, and vaccinations by country.

5. **Visualizations**  
     - Line charts for trends over time.
     - Bar chart for country comparison.
     - Choropleth map for global overview.

6. **Key Insights**  
     - Highlights trends, anomalies, and vaccination progress.

## Example Visualizations

- ![Total Cases Over Time](total_casesovertime.png)
- ![Total Deaths Over Time](total_deaths.png)
- ![Total Vaccinations Over Time](total_vaccinations.png)
- ![Total Cases by Country](total_casesbycountry.png)

## Key Insights

1. **Case Trends**: Kenya showed the highest total cases among the selected countries.
2. **Death Rates**: Kenya had a notably higher death rate.
3. **Vaccination Progress**: Tanzania led in vaccination rollout.
4. **Anomalies**: A spike in new cases in Kenya (2021-09 to 2022-05) was observed.
5. **Global Perspective**: The choropleth map highlights regions with the highest case density.

## Extending the Project

- Build an interactive dashboard with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).
- Incorporate additional metrics such as hospitalizations if available.
